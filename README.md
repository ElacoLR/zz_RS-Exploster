## Yay, my first public mod!
I tested with bunch of modded weapons, but there still can be some incompatibilities with other weapons that I don't use. <br><br>
Also, if you encounter an error when loading the server and are willing to report it, please write down the list of weapon mods you have with. It'll be very much appreciated. <br><br>
